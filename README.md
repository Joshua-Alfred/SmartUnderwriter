# SmartUnderwriter

### Abstract

This Underwriting Software is designed to read the Insurance Application Document, which is filled by the user, and thus a standardized Insurance Application Document template must be used so that the Software can easily read and store the data every time. The social media platforms are restricted to Twitter, Instagram and Google Fit API (as wearable data source) and can be further expanded by including other platforms and wearable APIs as well. Also, those social media accounts of users must be in public mode, so that extraction of user’s data will be possible.

The assumptions taken towards this software is that a reliable Internet Connection is available to the software for its proper functioning and validation using Cloud Services. The Insurance Application Document is assumed to contain the social media handles and the Wearable API Access token of the user, so that the software can read through and proceed for extraction of user data from those platforms. We also assume that the social media and wearable accounts of the user has been configured for public access for extraction and validation purposes. The rating score which is provided by the Software after the validation is assumed to be a tool that can help the Insurance Industry to frame the premium pricing much efficiently for the user.
This Project is built prominently on technologies like Java, Servlets and JSP, MySQL, Cloud Services like Google Cloud, AWS along with Web-based integrations using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Benefits

•	Social media timeline will yield more authentic results than those coming from the industry’s time-honored actuary tables. 
•	High-risk activities like smoking, drinking and weekend racecar driving are identifiable and verifiable.
•	If underwriters want to search the useful information related to Financial Information, Moral Hazard, and Morale Hazard, the social media data type of “social graph” is the best choice. This is because “social graph” shows how individuals are linked together, providing a picture of who is friends with whom, who follows whom, and people’s friends of friends 
•	Social graphs can give underwriters further insight into how an individual may perform in terms of risk based on the behavior of those to whom he or she is connected. 
•	As a result of the growing amount of information that is posted to social media networking sites, underwriting professionals, and the experts they engage, can find the social media be a useful investigative tool for conducting research and uncovering relevant information on underwriting. 
•	Data derived from social media sites can serve to provide further confirmation of the information filled in an insurance application form. 
•	Wearable data provides more evidence-based risk determination
•	Wearable data provides the detailed report of relationship between lifestyle behaviors (e.g. physical activity, nutrition, sleep) and health.

•	Researchers found that the steps per day stratifies mortality risk even after controlling for age, gender, smoking status, and various health indicators was consistent across methods. And also, the steps per day provides additional segmentation of mortality even after considering traditional underwriting attributes, such as smoking status, BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure and health history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
